abstract: Equity duration is the present value weighted cash flow maturity. It measures the sensitivity of the price to the change of interest rate. Using a present value decomposition approach, I calculate the contribution of cash flow news and discount rate news to the unexpected returns for portfolios based on equity duration. Surprisingly, the cash flow news is the main driver across portfolios that are composed of stocks with long duration or short duration. Stocks characterized by a shorter duration earn return premium over stocks with a longer duration. Though the short duration premium embeds value premium, it cannot be a substitute for the intangible adjusted book-to-market ratio. Portfolio analyses indicate that the premium is concentrated on small stocks and stocks that are possibly short-sale constrained.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We use present-value decomposition method to study the equity duration, and then study the short duration premium.
